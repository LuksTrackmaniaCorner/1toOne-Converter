# 1toOne-Converter

1toOne Converter is a third-party utility for the game series "Trackmania" game by "Nadeo".

It allows to convert Snow maps from Trackmania United to Maniaplanet. To play the maps, you will have to install the TMOne Alpine Titlepack by Unbitn.

The project is still heavily Work In Progress. Restructuring are in progress to increase Readability and Maintainability of the source code, while new features will be added.

### Usage

To use the program, either double-click and select the maps that you want to convert.
You can also start the program by dragging maps onto the .exe.
Converting multiple files at once is supported.

By default, the files will end up in the same folder as the original ones.
After the program is finished, the folder with the maps will be opened automatically.
Remember to manually calculate the shadows of the converted maps, 1toOneConverter sadly can't do this for you.

Please make sure that AlpineConversion.xml is in the same folder as 1toOneConverter.exe.
The program will not work otherwise.

Also make sure to check out the settings.exe file, if you want to customise the program.
You can specify an output folder for the converted .gbx files there, among other things
